# CDC Consumer Example: Using Broadway as CDC Consumer

[Broadway](/articles/19_Broadway/01_broadway_overview.md) has a group of [built-in Actors](/articles/19_Broadway/actors/04_queue_actors.md) that manage Pub / Sub asynchronous message handling. These Actors belong to the **queue** category and can also subscribe to Apache Kafka messages. This means that a [Broadway flow](/articles/19_Broadway/02a_broadway_flow_overview.md) can subscribe to [CDC messages](/articles/18_fabric_cdc/03_cdc_messages.md) published by Fabric to Kafka.
