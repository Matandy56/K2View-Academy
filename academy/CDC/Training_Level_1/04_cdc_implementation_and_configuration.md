# CDC Implementation and Configuration

Now that you are familiar with the CDC process and CDC messages, you are ready to learn how to add CDC fields to LU tables and how to configure Fabric to work with CDC consumers.

### What Will You Experience In This Learning Item?

By the end of this learning item you will:

- Know how to add CDC consumers to a Fabric project.
- Know how to add CDC fields to LU tables.
- Know how to configure Fabric to enable the CDC process.
- Check the CDC messages that are published for CDC fields.

### CDC Implementation

A CDC implementation consists of two steps:

1. Adding CDC consumers to the k2proj file of the Fabric project.
2. Adding CDC fields to selected LU table columns.

Please read [CDC Implementation Steps](/articles/18_fabric_cdc/05_cdc_consumers_implementation.md) to learn more about how to add a CDC implementation to a Fabric project.

### CDC Configuration

Please read [CDC Configuration](/articles/18_fabric_cdc/06_cdc_configuration.md) to learn how to configure the Fabric [config.ini file](/articles/02_fabric_architecture/05_fabric_main_configuration_files.md#configini) to support the CDC process.
