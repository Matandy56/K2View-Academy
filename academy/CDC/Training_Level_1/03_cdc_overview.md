# CDC Overview

**Welcome to the first section of this course!**

### What Will You Experience In This Learning Item?

By the end of the Change Data Capture (CDC) Introduction learning item you will know:

- What CDC is.
- About high level CDC flows.
- About CDC messages and publication flows.

To get started with CDC, please read the [CDC Overview](/articles/18_fabric_cdc/01_change_data_capture_overview.md).

### CDC Publication Flow

Fabric generally publishes CDC messages after updating an LU schema or LUI data.

Please read:

- [CDC Publication Flow](/articles/18_fabric_cdc/04_cdc_publication_flow.md) to learn which scenarios trigger the publication of CDC messages and about the different types of CDC messages.

- [CDC Messages](/articles/18_fabric_cdc/02_cdc_messages.md) to have a better understanding about the different types of CDC messages and to see examples of each message type.

- [CDC Process Architecture](articles/18_fabric_cdc/05_cdc_process_architecture.md) to have a better understanding of the CDC flow.

Now that you have read these articles, and have a better understanding of the CDC process, lets begin by defining CDC fields in the Fabric project.
