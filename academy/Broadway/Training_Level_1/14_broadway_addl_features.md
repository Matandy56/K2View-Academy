# Additional Broadway Features

### What Will You Experience In This Learning Item?

By the end of this learning item you will:

- Be familiar with the Actor Inheritance Mechanism.
- Learn what are the Inner flows, how to do Error handling and to manage Transactions.
- Create a Broadway flow with an Inner flow, an Error handler and a Transaction.



### Overview

After you have learned what is a Broadway flow, a Stage and an Actor it is time to get familiar with several additional Broadway features which are essential for creating complex business flows. These features are:

* **Actor Inheritance Mechanism** - ability to extend the Actor with additional logic and arguments, when it is required to use a specific business logic in several flows. For example, when you need to set the same date format for all the dates across all your Broadway flows.

* **Inner Flows** - a way to encapsulate a flow creating it as an Actor that can be used in other flows. For example, when you need to do the same validation across several Broadway flows.

* **Error Handling** - a built-in mechanism to handle exceptions in a flow by using an Error Handler Actor. The Actor's logic is validated and if it returns true, the flow continues. Otherwise the flow stops.

* **Transactions Management** - ability to start a transaction at any Stage of the flow and perform a commit or a rollback at the end of the transaction in the flow.

  

To learn about the described above functionality in more details, please refer to:

* [Actor Inheritance Mechanism](/articles/19_Broadway/06_export_actor.md).
* [Inner Flows](/articles/19_Broadway/22_broadway_flow_inner_flows.md).
* [Error Handling](/articles/19_Broadway/24_error_handling.md) and [Error Handling Actors](/articles/19_Broadway/actors/06_error_handling_actors.md).
* [Transactions](/articles/19_Broadway/23_transactions.md).



Now let's see few examples that will demonstrate the above Broadway features.
