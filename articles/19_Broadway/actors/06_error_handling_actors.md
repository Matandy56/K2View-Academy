# Error Handling Actors

Broadway has a built-in error handling mechanism that handles exceptions in a flow using **Error Handlers**. An error handler is defined using a Broadway Actor. Any Actor or an [Inner flow](/articles/19_Broadway/22_broadway_flow_inner_flows.md) can act as an error handler. 

This article describes the advanced error handling features provided by an **ErrorHandler** and an **ErrorFields** Actors.

For basic Broadway error handling mechanism, refer to [Error Handling article](/articles/19_Broadway/24_error_handling.md).
