# **Fabric Security Overview** 



K2View Fabric is a modern and highly secure distributed data management platform that securely liberates data from your existing systems and turns it into a dynamic resource that moves at the speed required by your business.

With more and more data breaches making the headlines in today's world, enterprises need to scrutinize their own security controls to ensure that their most valuable asset, data, is fully secured. 


 IT departments use a variety of encryption protocols to protect their data. However, when these protocols need to be applied to a diverse IT ecosystem with hundreds, or even thousands of interacting systems, the process can be cumbersome and lead to an all-or-nothing approach. This means that if the security controls for a particular system are breached, all the data in that system and possibly across all the interacting systems) will be compromised. 

By design, Fabric eliminates a significant number of potential large-scale breaches inherent to data exploration, while turning disconnected and untapped data into valuable new information.



 # **Fabric Security Arsenal** 

In this section, we will address how fabric security tools address each one of the layers at play in a Fabric cluster that has been fully deployed across multiple data centres and that is interacting with northbound or southbound systems spread across the cloud. 

We will show, in details, how to deal with each of the following components that are crucial to any Fabric implementation 

- Data stored in Fabric
- Interfaces 
- Web-services
- Role Based Access Control management

It is important to note that, here, we will only address the security features that are related to Fabric as a product. An entire section dealing with all the aspects of Fabric DevOps environment safeguarding, rules, policies and best practices is available [here](/articles/99_fabric_infras/devops/01_fabric_security_overview.md).
