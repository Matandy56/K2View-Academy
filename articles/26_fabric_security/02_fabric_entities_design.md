# **Fabric Data: secured-by-design** 



## The Logical Unit 

Most database management systems store data in silos, based on the type of data being stored (e.g. customer data, financial data, address data, device data). When data is needed, hundreds or thousands of tables may need to be queried using complex joins to deliver the information. The process is very cumbersome, complex and time consuming.  

Fabric organizes and stores data very differently all together. By storing data based on the needs of the business and not on a pre-defined structure, enterprises can improve the speed, agility and with security of their data. 

Any business-related entity (a customer, a product, a service, etc.) can be represented by a Logical Unit. A Logical Unit is associated with a schema that defines all the relevant pieces of data associated with the defined business entity. That schema reflects a business-oriented structure (Logical Unit) containing relevant data from every table and object from every system (e.g., 100 tables from the CRM system running MySQL with 200 tables from the billing system residing on Oracle).



## Logical Unit Encryption 

Fabric encrypts each Logical Unit Instance (LUI) using a AES256 algorithm in OFB mode and creates a unique encryption for each LUI. The LUI data is only readable using the master key which is also always encrypted. 

This additional atomic-level encryption delivers greater protection for sensitive data and eliminates the chance of a large-scale data breach.



## Fabric Hashing Mechanism

Data related to Fabric The Fabric Masking mechanism uses the SHA-256 algorithm for hashing data. 

For example:

- An Instance Key used to encrypt LU Instances is the hashed combination of the LU name, LU Instance, and the master key.
- Fabric masking utility uses the SHA-256 algorithm when hashing the original value of any encrypted field (such as interface passwords etc ...).

## Fabric Project Encryption

The following illustration shows how Logical Units Instances inherit their own private encryption key based on Fabric master key and the LU they belon to.

### Fabric Master Key 

#### Master Key Generation

Fabric generates its master key using Java built-in methods for AES-256 with GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) keys generation. 
The master key is generated by Fabric, using the manual Fabric command, and is encrypted using the protection key. 
Once The new generated Master Key is broken into bytes. Each byte is stored in a separate record in the dedicated Cassandra table. 
Using Cassandra distribution data logic, the parts of the key are stored across different nodes. 
Access to the dedicated Cassandra table is enabled only through K2View Fabric, while regular access through Cassandra has been disabled.


The master key is encrypted using the protection key. Fabric uses ARS256 algorithm to encrypt the master key.

#### Master Key Rotation

Master key rotation enables generating and activating a new master key. The new master key impacts instance IDs saved in Cassandra from the moment it was generated onwards. The already existing instance IDs are not impacted by the new key, until they are next sync-ed and saved on Cassandra.

Upon retrieval of a specific instance ID, K2View Fabric collects the information of the Master Key that was used for the encryption of the LU instance and performs on the fly the de-encryption of the data.
