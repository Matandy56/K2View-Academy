# **Fabric Data: secured-by-design** 



## The Logical Unit 

Most database management systems store data in silos, based on the type of data being stored (e.g. customer data, financial data, address data, device data). When data is needed, hundreds or thousands of tables may need to be queried using complex joins to deliver the information. The process is very cumbersome, complex and time consuming.  

Fabric organizes and stores data very differently all together. By storing data based on the needs of the business and not on a pre-defined structure, enterprises can improve the speed, agility and with security of their data. 

Any business-related entity (a customer, a product, a service, etc.) can be represented by a Logical Unit. A Logical Unit is associated with a schema that defines all the relevant pieces of data associated with the defined business entity. That schema reflects a business-oriented structure (Logical Unit) containing relevant data from every table and object from every system (e.g., 100 tables from the CRM system running MySQL with 200 tables from the billing system residing on Oracle).



## Logical Unit Encryption 

Fabric encrypts each Logical Unit Instance (LUI) using a AES256 algorithm in OFB mode and creates a unique encryption for each LUI. The LUI data is only readable using the master key which is also always encrypted. 

This additional atomic-level encryption delivers greater protection for sensitive data and eliminates the chance of a large-scale data breach.



## Fabric Hashing Mechanism

Data related to Fabric The Fabric Masking mechanism uses the SHA-256 algorithm for hashing data. 

For example:

- An Instance Key used to encrypt LU Instances is the hashed combination of the LU name, LU Instance, and the master key.
- Fabric masking utility uses the SHA-256 algorithm when hashing the original value of any encrypted field (such as interface passwords etc ...).





**Protection Key** 

The AES-256 protection key is used to encrypt the master key and is stored in the Keystore, which is also locked by a password. 

**Master Key (encryption/decryption)** 

A unique, encrypted AES-256 key is generated by Fabric and can change from time to time. The master key is broken into bytes, where each byte is stored in a separate record in a dedicated Cassandra table. Fabric generates a key description which is a logical identifier for each master key.

**Instance Key**

The instance key is used to encrypt the LUI. Each instance key is unique and is hashed via the SHA-256 algorithm that creates a combination of the LU name, LU Instance, and the master key.
