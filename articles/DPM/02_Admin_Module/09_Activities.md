# Activities 

## Activity Details

When selecting one of the lines in the Activities table, or by using the “Edit” icon, the system presents the “Edit Activity” pop-up screen.

In this screen the user can:

- Change the name of the Activity.
- Change the flow that is used to fulfill the request, by selecting from the drop-down list of the available flows (only flows that were finalized are presented).
- Add a new flow – using this button the user is taken the “Create a new flow” screen. 
- Update the flow version. If the option “latest” is selected, then every time a new version of the selected flow is marked as “finalized” the Activity will be automatically updated to use this latest flow.
- Update the Activity SLA, in hours.

Any update done on the Activity impacts only requests from the update moment forward. Requests that were already submitted will maintain the previous parameters. 

## Add an Activity

In order to add a new Activity to a Regulation, Select the Regulation from the Regulation screen, and then click the “Add an Activity” button on the “Regulation Activities” screen. 
The pop-up screen that is presented is the same as the one used for “Edit and Activity” in the chapter above.
