# Admin Module

**Overview**

The Admin module controls the definitions of which regulations are covered by the DPM, the Activities that are supported for each regulation, the Flows that are executed, user and role management, consent management, and more.

**Admin Menu options**

Once a user logs into the DPM system as Administrator, the Admin menu options are presented on the left side of the screen, and the list of Regulations is presented in the center.

By using the Menu on the left side of the window, the Administrator can access any of the DPM configuration options. The details for each of those options is described in this chapter.
