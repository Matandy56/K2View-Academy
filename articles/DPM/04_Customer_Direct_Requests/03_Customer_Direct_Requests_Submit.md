## Customer Submits a Request

When a customer selects the option to create a new request, the system directs the customer to a screen where the request details are collected. The list of requests type and the information that should be provided for each of them is defined by implementation using the Admin module.

When submitting a new request, the customer first selects the relevant regulation out of the Regulation dropdown list. 
The customer can add notes to the Request before submitting it. 
The list of Request Types options that is presented at the bottom of the submission form changes according to the selected Regulation.
Once the Request type is selected, the right side of the form presents the list of fields that should be completed before submitting the request. This list is automatically built in accordance with the Request type.

The customer number is not requested when submitting the request, since the customer had already provided this identification when entering the system.
