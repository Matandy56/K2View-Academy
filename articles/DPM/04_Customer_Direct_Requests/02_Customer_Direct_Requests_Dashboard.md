## Customer Dashboard

When a customer logs into the DPM user interface, the initial screen that is presented is the customer’s Dashboard screen, which includes the following items:

- Submit a new request button: the option to submit a request.
- Open Requests: the number of requests that are in processing for this customer.
- View Requests: view the list of this customer’s requests.

The same options can be reached also from the menu items on the left side of the screen.
