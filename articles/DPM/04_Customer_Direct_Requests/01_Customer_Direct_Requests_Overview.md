# Customer Direct Requests

The DPM system provides different ways to allow a customer to submit a DPM request, search for a request previously submitted and view its details:

- DPM includes built-in user interface for the use of a customer.
- DPM provides a set of APIs that can be integrated in the customer portal of each corporate that uses the system. 

## DPM Customer’s Built-in User Interface

DPM includes a set of screens that allow a customer to submit DPM Requests, as well as view his own request’s details.
