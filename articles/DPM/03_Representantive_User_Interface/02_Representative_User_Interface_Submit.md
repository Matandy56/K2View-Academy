## Representative Submits a Request

A representative can submit a request on behalf of a customer, using the “Submit a Request” button that is located on the search screen or by using the menu on the left. The list of requests type and the information that should be provided for each of them is defined by implementation using the Admin module.

When submitting a new request, the representative first selects the regulation that applies to the customer out of the Regulation dropdown list and fills the customer number at the Customer field. 
The representative can add notes to the Request before submitting it. 
The list of Request Types options that is presented at the bottom of the submission form changes according to the selected Regulation.
Once the Request type is selected, the right side of the form presents the list of fields that should be completed before submitting the request. This list is automatically adapted in accordance with the Request type.
