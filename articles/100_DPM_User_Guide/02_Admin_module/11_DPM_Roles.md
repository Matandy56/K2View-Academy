# DPM Roles

## Overview

The DPM roles define the functions within the DPM which are enabled for each user:

•	**Admin users**: Those are the users responsible to configure the flows that should be executed in each Data Subject Request. An Admin user can perform all the Activities that are part of the Admin module, such as:
o	Define Regulation and the Activities it includes.
o	Create or update flows, including their stages and tasks.
o	Manage corporate roles and assign users to corporate roles.
o	Map between corporate roles and the DPM functions.

•	**Customer Service Representative (CSR)**: a CSR is a call center representative attending customer requests by submitting a Data Privacy related request on their behalf. A CSR can:
o	Submit a new request.
o	Inspect the details of an existing request, without changing its details. 

•	 **Data Steward**: data stewards are users that are a part of the Request fulfilment process and are responsible to execute a specific task in the request flow. Data steward can:
o	View the list of open tasks that should be handled by the group of stewards he is a part of.
o	Mark a task as assigned to him to avoid other stewards from working on the same task
o	Review, Update, or approve a task in order to move it to the next step
o	Release a task that is assigned to him

•	**Case Owner**:
o	Each customer request that is submitted in the DPM is assigned to a specific case owner. The role of the case owner is to follow up on the request progress and assure it is being completed within the expected SLA. A case owner can:
o	View the list of requests and filter them to identify risks of missing the SLA
o	Open a specific request and view or complete its stages, tasks. 

•	**Supervisor**: The supervisor is a user that is responsible to manage the allocation of requests to the case owners.
o	Access the dashboard menu and review overall view of the requests
o	Define the criteria for the allocation of requests to Case owners.  

•	**Customer**: Data Subject Requests can be submitted directly by a customer. A customer can:
o	Create a new request
o	Search for his requests 
o	Check the status of his requests
o	Review the data provided as an output of a completed request



The DPM roles are predefined in the system. Each of them includes the set of screens and actions that are relevant for the role it represents. DPM roles are used by the Administrator in order to grant a specific corporate group the ability to view or execute actions in the DPM system. The way those roles are used is explained in the next section about the Corporate roles.
