#### “Reminders” Tab:

Reminders are used in order to preemptively call attention to Tasks that might not be progressing at the expected pace. 
In the Reminders tab, the user can define one or more reminders that should be sent after a predetermined time.

Reminders are always sent to the current mail of the user or Role. This means that if the mail of a user or Role is changed, reminders that are generated by DPM from that point on will be sent to the new address.
The e-mail addresses used by the Reminders can be configured by the Administrator in the Role Management and User Management screens.

In addition to the reminders that are configured in this tab, the system also has an automatic reminder that is sent if the Task reaches its deadline and was not yet completed. This automatic Reminder mail is sent to the mail address of the “Task Owner” (that is configured in the “Task” tab). As this is an automatic e-mail and there is no need to configure a Reminder explicitly for this purpose.
