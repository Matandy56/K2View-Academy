# Example of Invoking HTTP REST Call

### Objective and Introduction

In this example we demonstrates how a Telco mobile carrier can use customer's IP domain (assumed as rederived during LUI sync) to reveal his current location (such as country, city, long&lat coordinates) . 

This can be useful for cases when a customer calls to complain about bad service, where carrier knows that there are problems in some areas. Another example that it can be used is when customer is being abroad and carrier can suggest him best roaming packages.

For this purpose we will use REST call to one of the existing IP Geolocation services - https://ip-api.com/. This service provides several response format options and we will use the JSON format, using a JSON parser provided in an external JAR. See here to learn about [External Jars](/articles/31_external_resources/01_external_jars.md) usage. 

We will apply this capability at an enrichment function.

### Example Implementation

1. Place the "org.json" JAR at the fabric JARs directory (can be downloaded [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json). for more information about this library see [here](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java))

2. Add to the Enrichment Logic file these import statements:

   ```java
   import org.json.JSONObject;
   import org.json.JSONArray;
   
   import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
   import java.net.URL;
   ```

   The first 2 lines aimed for JSON parsing while the later are for performing the HTTP call (Java internal support, thus no need an external JAR).

3. Following is the the code example (note that the following code does not include the read/write of source/target data)

   ```java
   log.info("HTTP REST CALLS fucntion");
     
   String userIP = "24.48.0.1";
     
   URL url = new URL("http://ip-api.com/json/" + userIP);
   HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
   con.setRequestMethod("GET");
   int responseCode = con.getResponseCode();
   log.info("Response code: " + responseCode);
   if (responseCode == 200) { // read the response
   	BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(con.getInputStream()));
     	String inputLine;
     	StringBuffer content = new StringBuffer();
     	while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
         	content.append(inputLine);
   	}
     	in.close();
       //parse response
     	JSONObject jsonResponse = new JSONObject(content.toString());
     	log.info("countryCode: " + jsonResponse.getString("countryCode"));	
     	log.info("city: " + jsonResponse.getString("city"));
     	log.info("lon: " + jsonResponse.getNumber("lon"));	
     	log.info("lat: " + jsonResponse.getNumber("lat"));
   } else {
   	log.info("The request call was failed");
   }
     
     con.disconnect();
   ```

     \* Note: for simplicity we skipped on the null value validations and on catching exceptions.
   
   
   
   In some cases the REST API requires **authentication & authorization** to be sent as headers. At the "java.net" library which we used in the example, this can be achieved by using the **setRequestProperty** method. For example, when the API provider supplied us user-name + passwords and works with base authentication, the following can be used:
   
   ```java
   String encoded = Base64.encode(username+":"+password);
   cons.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Basic "+encoded);
   ```

â€‹		There are alternative HTTPP client JAR, such as apache, which already have specific "setHeader" method.
