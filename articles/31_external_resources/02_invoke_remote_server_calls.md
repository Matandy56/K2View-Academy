# Invoking Remote API Calls

Data can be retrieved from remote services, for example; during an LUI sync to combine the data from an API with the data in the source DB or, to call and update a remote API. 

An understanding of remote API protocols and their formats is required to interact with remote servers and parse their response. To do so, we recommend using Java JAR libraries or generated code that encapsulate these interactions into Java methods and objects.

For more information about external JAR libraries, click [here](/articles/31_external_resources/01_external_jars.md).

For examples refer to:

* [HTTP REST API Call with JSON response](/articles/31_external_resources/03_invoke_http_rest_call_example.md). 
* [HTTP SOAP Call](/articles/31_external_resources/04_invoke_soap_call_example.md). 


Note that [CDC](/articles/18_fabric_cdc/) and [Broadway Streams Actors](/articles/19_Broadway/04_built_in_actor_types.md#streams) can also be used for invoking remote API calls.
