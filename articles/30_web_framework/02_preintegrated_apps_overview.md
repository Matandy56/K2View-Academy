- [Admin](03_web_admin_application.md) - UI utility to manage various Fabric Server activities, such as monitoring batch processes, managing the credentials or executing Fabric commands.
- [Graphit](/articles/15_web_services_and_graphit/17_Graphit/01_graphit_overview.md) - UI utility to design Fabric [Web Services](/articles/15_web_services_and_graphit/01_web_services_overview.md) responses. Graphit provides a very user-friendly interface and requires minimal coding while enabling powerful debugging capabilities. The content of a response is defined during its execution, either according to specific parameters relevant to the specific Web Service call, or by retrieving dynamic information from other databases or interfaces.
- Statistics - JMX monitoring of the processes running on the Fabric server, Cassandra, etc.
- [Swagger](/articles/15_web_services_and_graphit/09_swagger.md) - complete framework implementation for invocation and testing of Fabric Web Services.
- Trace - ???
- Documentation - links to the frequently-used K2View documentation, such as the Knowledge base and Fabric Java docs.
- <!--6.4 Data Catalog / Data Editor - -->
