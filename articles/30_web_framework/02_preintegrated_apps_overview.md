Click ![image](images/30_02_icon.PNG) icon to open the list of applications:

- [Admin](03_web_admin_application.md) - web application to manage various Fabric Server activities, such as monitoring batch processes, managing the credentials or executing Fabric commands.
- [Graphit](/articles/15_web_services_and_graphit/17_Graphit/01_graphit_overview.md) - UI utility to design Fabric [Web Services](/articles/15_web_services_and_graphit/01_web_services_overview.md) responses. Graphit provides a very user-friendly interface and requires minimal coding while enabling powerful debugging capabilities. The content of a response is defined during its execution, either according to specific parameters relevant to the specific Web Service call, or by retrieving dynamic information from other databases or interfaces.
- Statistics - JMX monitoring of the processes running on the Fabric server, Cassandra, etc.
- [Swagger](/articles/15_web_services_and_graphit/09_swagger.md) - complete framework implementation for invocation and testing of Fabric Web Services.
- [Trace](/articles/29_tracing/05_trace_view.md) - Fabric powerful mechanism for writing internal operations performed by Fabric into the trace files. Tracing can be set on both global and session levels. The result of the tracing process is logged into a file that can be loaded for viewing in the Web Framework.
- Documentation - links to the frequently-used K2View documentation, such as the Knowledge base and Fabric Java docs.
