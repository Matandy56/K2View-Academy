# Web Framework Overview

K2View Web Framework is a container for hosting multiple web applications and providing services out of the box. The purpose of the K2View Web Framework is to serve as a user's desktop that contains frequently-used Web-based applications running on the same application server. Instead of typing the URL of each web application, the user logs in into the K2View Web Framework and selects the required application from the context menu. 

The framework can be opened using the following URL: **http://[Fabric IP address]:3213/app/admin/cluster**.

Login - ??? is there RBA / different permissions for different users???

K2View Web Framework provides a list of pre-integrated applications whereby additional applications can be integrated into the framework using the supported methods of the **k2api** object and **k2.css** for having unified look & feel.
