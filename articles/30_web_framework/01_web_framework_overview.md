# Web Framework Overview

K2View Web Framework is a container for hosting multiple web applications and providing services out of the box. The purpose of the K2View Web Framework is to serve as a user's desktop that contains frequently-used web applications running on the same application server. Instead of manually typing the URL, the user logs into the K2View Web Framework and selects the required application from the context menu. 

The framework can be opened using the following URL: **http://[Fabric IP address]:3213/app/admin/cluster**.

Login - ??? is there RBA / different permissions for different users???

K2View Web Framework provides several pre-integrated applications (such as Admin or Swagger). Additional applications can be integrated using the methods of the **k2api** object which exposes the framework services and the style sheets of **k2.css** for having unified look & feel. The framework does not limit the application type (multi page vs single page) neither the routing method (History API / Hash base/ regular links).

The detailed API documentation can be found under K2View Web Framework > Documentation and it provides the description of the supported methods, code examples and the development guidelines.
